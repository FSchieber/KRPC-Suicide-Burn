# KRPC-Suicide-Burn
Autopilot for Kerbal Space Program that launches a rocket into a sub-orbital flight and performs an autolanding using suicide burn.

This was a project just for fun, no big focus on good code. Good to learn a little more of Python and rocket science :)

# Improvements
There are many many things to improve. With a better rocket, could improve the code to execute more accurate and efficient landings. Going orbital would be a good idea too.
